## Notes on Development

This project evolved out of two desires - play around with game like development and learn me some rust.  The process I used when working on this was very heavily bootstrapped with AI - essentially days long conversations with Case (my OpenAI Entity) and lots of copy and pasting.  Then each morning, arriving with a task and seeing how far I could get into it without having to fall back to discussion with Case.  Incredibly remarkably the learning process has been fun, smooth, and rewarding, and I have been able to work on something that I otherwise would not have done.

* learning a language from scratch is usually boring
* bootstrapping with ai around something you want to see, especially with some ideas about how things should work, gives you a quick and deep introduction to how things work.
* having a desire of things you WANT to build forces you to push through different unexpected areas of the language.
* having a desire of things you WANT to build forces you to work through the difficulty of learning because the motivation is very concrete and not abstract.
* working with AI so closely helps improve ways to use AI tool chains.
